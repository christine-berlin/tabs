# Tabcreator
Converts piano sheet music to ukulele tabs and writes them to a file. The program can also convert a triad or a four tone. 
The best possible tab will be calculated. 
Best means, the tab with the shortest distances, so that all notes are close together on the fretboard, 
so one can play it without problems.
